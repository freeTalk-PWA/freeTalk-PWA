  "description": "Previously called SuhBit – a portmanteau of “Suhbat” (“conversation” in Uyghur language) and the well-known computer concept of “bit”. freeTalk.PS is a DIY kit that could be used as an alternative to traditional messaging platforms. You can use it to set up your own messaging service in a decentralized manner & away from any possible surveillance. This project is a gesture of hacktivism, against the constant targeting of truth-seeking journalists under the Israeli apartheid and around the world. It is also a stand against China’s repression of Uyghurs in Xinjiang.",
